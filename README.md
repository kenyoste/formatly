## 📦 Installation (1 Line CDN Setup)

Add this single script tag to your HTML to get started:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kenyoste/formatly@main/formatly.js"></script>
✅ No need to import any CSS — all styles are included dynamically.

🧪 Usage
Simply add the id="formatly" attribute to any input element you want to enhance:

html
Kopyala
Düzenle
<!-- Textarea example -->
<textarea id="formatly" placeholder="Start typing..."></textarea>

<!-- Input example -->
<input id="formatly" type="text" placeholder="Short text input" />

<!-- contenteditable div example -->
<div id="formatly" contenteditable="true" style="min-height: 120px;">
  Editable content block with Formatly
</div>
Formatly will auto-detect and enhance these elements when the DOM loads.

🖼️ Demo
Try Formatly live in your browser:
🔗 Live Demo (Replace with your actual demo URL)

You can also open demo.html inside the GitHub repository for a local preview.

🌒 Dark Mode Support
Formatly automatically detects your app’s theme and adjusts its UI accordingly.

To enable dark mode, add one of the following to your root HTML element:

html
Kopyala
Düzenle
<html class="dark">
<!-- OR -->
<body data-theme="dark">
Formatly UI elements will automatically switch to a darker palette.

⚙️ Customization
Want to tailor the editor to your app’s needs?

CSS: All styles are injected dynamically, but you can override them with your own CSS rules after Formatly loads.

JS: Extend Formatly by forking the GitHub repo and modifying the logic. All code is clean, modular, and well-commented.

Multiple editors: You can place Formatly on multiple fields in the same page by giving each a unique id.

🔧 Advanced Usage (Programmatic Init)
If you want to initialize Formatly manually (instead of auto-loading via id="formatly"), you can use:

js
Kopyala
Düzenle
// Example (if your field doesn't have id="formatly")
Formatly.attach(document.querySelector('#myField'));
